            <h3 class="question">Q. How do I create an event?</h3>
                <p class="answer">A. To create an event, click the plus button at the end of your events or click the "New Event" tab at the top of 
                    the page. From there it should lead you to the menu to create an event hosted by you. When creating an event be sure to include
                    all of the necessary information and make sure to be clear. This includes a name, a date, a location, and some way to contact
                    you in the description in case of questions. Be creative and get to making your events and connecting with others!

            <h3 class="question">Q. Where can I find the time for an event??</h3>
                <p class="answer">A. In most cases, the time for an event should be clearly displayed with the event card. However, depending on how it was  
                    formatted, the date may also be included in the description. If it is none of those places then you are probably out of luck, unless the 
                    event host included a form of contact, in which case you can contact them and ask for the needed information.

            <h3 class="question">Q. How can I find an event that is right for me?</h3>
                <p class="answer">A. You're in luck! We have many resources here on EventRex for this purpose. First there is the search tool. Here you can search 
                    through a variety of categories in order to find the event that is just right for you. Next on the list of options is the Recommended Events. We
                    save you the trouble of searching and choose three events displayed on the home page that try to best match with your choices in past event and hosted events. 
                    Lastly there is the Featured Events section of the home page, located just below the Recommended. You might wonder, what is the difference? The 
                    featured events are the showcased upcoming events, these are the big, fun, fancy, etc. events. They are based on recommendations and are upvoted.
                    Hopefully with the assistance of these three tools you may find the right event for you.

            <h3 class="question">Q. What if I don't have any good event ideas but want to host an event?</h3>
                <p class="answer">A. The purpose of our page is to bring people together and in the process lift-others, so we wouldn't leave you with no inspiration!
                    We have a lovely list of event ideas located in the "Inspiration" page accessible through the tab at the top of the screen. Hopefully something there may
                    spark your creative juices and bring forth a revolutionary idea! Also, if there is nothing you think of even then, there is the category called
                    "Get-Together" or the "Other" category where you can meet up with people regardless of your idea.
